# Why this repository?

<br />

A simple repository just to remember the important things to do (in my opinion) after initializing an app with Create React App.

<br />

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

## Documentation

- [CRA](CRA.md) - Getting Started with Create React App
- [PRETTIER](PRETTIER.md) - How was Prettier set up?
